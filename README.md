Just like my [11ty Tailwind JIT starter](https://github.com/kkgthb/11ty-tailwind-jit), I did Gatsby.  Wheeeee!

Maybe one day I'll make a starter -- for now, I just added it to an old project.  The [commit history](https://github.com/kkgthb/web-site-gatsby-07-tailwind-jit/commit/4c449ad5e8e901c48efe61046c31367c6abd55e7) is probably your best source of what changed.
